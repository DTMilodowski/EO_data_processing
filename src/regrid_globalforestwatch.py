# This function analyses the global forest watch forest loss dataset to provide
# forest loss time series at a given spatial resolution.  Forest loss is
# calculated based on the fractional area of each pixel for which forest loss
# occurs in a specified timestep.  Initial estimates will be annual, but
# subsequently will move onto monthly estimates using FORMA to distribute the
# change through the year.
